I've realized how daunting and unreasonable
the task of writing a standard C library is,
so I'm going to achive this. It probably
doesn't work in it's current state, but feel
free to fiddle with or fork it.

This is minilibc, a standard C library
that aims to be easy to read and understand,
to catch undefined behavior, and to be
mostly written in C.
